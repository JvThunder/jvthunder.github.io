I am Joshua Adrian Cahyono, a curious student and an avid Machine Learning enthusiast, deeply passionate about exploring the vast potential of AI and its applications. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). My interest lies in learning and diving deeper into topics of Mathematics, Computer Science, and AI.

My current focus is on state-of-the-art ML models, particularly in Generative AI advancements, Agentic systems, and Reinforcement Learning. I am deeply fascinated by the dynamics of intelligent agents, their interactions in multi-agent environments, and how RL can drive optimal decision-making in complex systems. I am particularly excited about leveraging RL to enable autonomous agents to learn, collaborate, and innovate in real-world applications.

I aspire to pursue a PhD in the near future, dedicating my efforts to research that advances our understanding of reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and their applications in real-world problems. My dream is to create a significant positive impact on society, leveraging Machine Learning as a key to solving complex, global challenges. Looking at past and current trends, I firmly believe that AI and Machine Learning hold the power to transform industries, improve lives, and address the world's most pressing issues. Through continuous learning, innovation, and collaboration, I am determined to contribute meaningfully to this exciting field.
